Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) developed by NVIDIA. It allows developers to use the power of NVIDIA GPUs (graphics processing units) for general-purpose computing, including deep learning.

CUDA provides developers with the tools and functionalities needed to harness the raw computational power of NVIDIAâ€™s GPUs. It allows developers to direct specific computing tasks to the more efficient GPU rather than the CPU.
